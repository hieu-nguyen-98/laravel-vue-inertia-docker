# Simple User Management

A [Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/) Laravel application built using **[Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze)** + **[Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com)** + **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**. This project provides a foundation for implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for user management, utilizing Spatie's [Laravel Permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/introduction) package, to provide a flexible and efficient way to assign roles and permissions to users, ensuring granular control over access levels.

### Build Docker Containers
```
cd simple-user-management
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

### Install Dependencies

```
php artisan key:generate
php artisan storage:link
```
> Note: Though these commands are already ran in `Dockerfile` (php and node), you can re-run them if new libraries/packages are installed.
```
# Backend
composer install

# Frontend
npm install
```

### Run Database Migrations and Seeders
```
docker compose exec php sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

## Usage

### Start the Development server

Dev server is already ran inside `node` container. No need to explicitly run `npm run dev`.

> Note: Please be advised that running this project on a Windows-based system may result in slower performance due to the limitations of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If you are using Windows, I recommend to run `npm run dev` outside of the Docker container with Node.js and npm installed.

### Access the Application

Visit http://localhost in your web browser.
